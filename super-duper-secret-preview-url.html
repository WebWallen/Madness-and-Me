    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>How a Mental Breakdown Led to a Life-Altering Breakthrough</h3>
    <h4>Brace yourself for the most important book you’ll ever read.</h4>
    <p>Heads-up: this preview is optimized for mobile.</p>
    <p>If you&#x27;re on a laptop or desktop computer, <a href="https://mcusercontent.com/3816e2b0915fda6c2f04a518d/files/8e1a7f8c-9d9f-4fed-943e-20a2d3bac25b/Madness_and_Me_Preview.pdf" target="_blank">this PDF might look better</a> (link opens in a new tab).</p>
    <p><strong>In the winter of 2017, I suffered a manic episode, also known as bipolar mania.</strong> </p>
    <p>The biggest symptom of mania is paranoia. </p>
    <p>You feel as if the entire world -- including your lover, friends, family, and strangers -- is conspiring against you. </p>
    <p><strong>Paranoid thoughts often involve a fear of being hurt or killed.</strong> </p>
    <p>When the fight-or-flight mechanism is always active, bad things happen. </p>
    <p>You’ll behave in strange ways… ways so strange you might get arrested and branded a felon. </p>
    <p><strong>America is the best country in the world. That said, I have high standards for myself and the nation as a whole.</strong> </p>
    <p>I learned many societal functions of our great country are severely broken. </p>
    <p>This applies to: court, criminal justice, law enforcement, and mental health rehabilitation. </p>
    <p><strong>The book also includes uncomfortable truths you’ll never see covered on the news.</strong> </p>
    <p>Examples include a presidential assassination program that doesn’t explicitly exclude Americans from being targeted. </p>
    <p><strong>No trial or conviction is necessary.</strong> </p>
    <p>If you’re skeptical, consult the appendix and fact check the sources. It’d be foolish to believe anything just because an author said so. </p>
    <p><strong>The opening chapters begin with a narrative written from the perspective of my past self.</strong> </p>
    <p>Being upfront about the deluded thoughts that governed my odd behavior is the best way to help you see how mania corrupts the mind. </p>
    <p><strong>If it’s not treated quickly, the condition worsens until you go nuts. </strong></p>
    <p>I’m discussing madness, which many mental health professionals call: “psychosis.” Both words describe the same concept. </p>
    <p><strong>Your sick brain starts to hallucinate.</strong> </p>
    <p>You see, hear, and feel stuff that didn’t occur. Your senses conspire to manipulate you. </p>
    <p>In the short-term, it’s horrifying. In the long-term, you’re left feeling as if your perceptions can’t be trusted. </p>
    <p><strong>People who suffer a mental breakdown are ten times more likely to kill themselves than the average American.</strong> </p>
    <p>It&#x27;s a traumatic event. Many people commit suicide before they give their scars enough time to heal. </p>
    <p><strong>I was seconds away from suicide myself.</strong> </p>
    <p>But I resisted the urge. It’s the best decision I ever made. Brace yourself for a wild ride...</p>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <h3>The Meltdown That Turned My Life Upside Down: On Bipolar Mania and Manic Episodes</h3>
    <h4>That one time I randomly got arrested while eating breakfast.</h4>
    <p><strong>I woke up in a sweat and knew I’d be dead by dawn.</strong> </p>
    <p>The United States government has a kill list called the Disposition Matrix. </p>
    <p>It’s not only used for terrorist threats. </p>
    <p><strong>Even Americans can be assassinated without a trial or conviction. </strong></p>
    <p>How did I end up on the kill list? </p>
    <p>It didn’t make sense.</p>
    <p><strong>I saw signs of danger everywhere.</strong> </p>
    <p>Friends and family were in on the scheme. </p>
    <p>Everyone kept making comments that involved fires and furnaces. It couldn’t be a coincidence. </p>
    <p>People often make word choices that signal a lie or hidden intent. This is the method they’d use to kill me.</p>
    <p><strong>My house would be set on fire with me and Dixie, a ten year old beagle I loved dearly, trapped inside. </strong></p>
    <p>At the time, I lived in an old and poorly maintained house. No windows opened. </p>
    <p>They&#x27;d start the fire while we were asleep, be confident in their assumption we wouldn’t get out, and blame the tragedy on a mechanical failure. No investigation would follow. </p>
    <p><strong>I had to devise an escape plan.</strong> </p>
    <p>It would be hard since every device was bugged. According to classified documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency’s mission is: “Collect it all.” </p>
    <p><strong>Their objective is to capture all electronic communication and store the content in a database. </strong></p>
    <p>They have the capability to record anything you say or do around smartphones, computers, and tablets. </p>
    <p>If they ever decide you’re a threat to the Establishment&#x27;s agenda, this information could be accessed and used against you.</p>
    <p>So I left all electronics at home and drove to the library. Instead of using a computer, I talked to a librarian, and obtained a phonebook. </p>
    <p>I called a taxi service and scheduled a ride to the airport. Sneakily, I’d leave my car parked in the driveway. </p>
    <p><strong>The charade wouldn’t last, but it’d buy enough time to throw them off my scent. </strong></p>
    <p>Then I went home and laid down for a final cuddle with the dog. </p>
    <p>This was the worst part. I couldn’t stop crying.<strong> </strong></p>
    <p>Dixie and I had been best friends for a decade. She was my doggy daughter. </p>
    <p><strong>I felt guilty for leaving Dixie at home. But there was no time. And who could I trust? </strong></p>
    <p>The conspiracy was so deep its tentacles reached my closest confidants.<strong> </strong></p>
    <p>Their problem was with me, not the dog. </p>
    <p>With such powerful surveillance methods, they’d notice I wasn’t home due to the lack of speech and movement. </p>
    <p><strong>By putting miles between us, I hoped to spare Dixie from a horrible death.</strong></p>
    <p>Despite the risk involved -- no devices should’ve been used since they can trace you via GPS -- I logged onto Facebook via laptop.</p>
    <p>I asked a friend to take care of Dixie as soon as I arrived at the airport. </p>
    <p>They were compromised like everybody else, but also loved dogs. And I’d never forgive myself for abandoning her. </p>
    <p><strong>Next, I went to the ticket counter, and picked a random flight. </strong></p>
    <p>When you’re against an enemy who can trace your every movement, the only real solution is to be unpredictable. </p>
    <p>The flight would put me in Florida by midnight. Four hours later, I landed and hailed a taxi. </p>
    <p><strong>To continue the trend of chaos, I let the driver pick my hotel. It was seedy but worked. </strong></p>
    <p>The next day, I took a walk and found a Perkins Restaurant. </p>
    <p>I relaxed into a booth, sipped a cup of coffee, and ate an omelet. </p>
    <p><strong>After breakfast, I approached the cashier. My debit card was deactivated. </strong></p>
    <p>Not a part of the conspiracy. </p>
    <p>Use a debit card in a different state without notifying the bank and fraud protection kicks in. </p>
    <p><strong>This presented a problem. </strong></p>
    <p>I left my cellphone at home. </p>
    <p>Like the parked car, I hoped this would confuse the enemy, since smartphones are easy to trace. </p>
    <p>Without reactivating my debit card, I wouldn’t be able to pay. I asked to use their phone and they refused. </p>
    <p><strong>Angry, I walked back into the dining room, and asked diners the same question. </strong></p>
    <p>They refused, too. </p>
    <p>Paranoia roared back to life. Everyone in the restaurant was aligned against me. </p>
    <p><strong>Perkins staff called 911. </strong></p>
    <p>Two officers walked inside. They asked me to leave. I stayed seated. Then it became violent. </p>
    <p>They forcibly removed me from the booth. Bystanders got involved in the brawl. </p>
    <p>I was thrown to the ground. An elderly man shoved his cane against my skull. Others had me pinned down from all sides. </p>
    <p><strong>After a struggle, the officers dragged me outside, where three more cops awaited.</strong> </p>
    <p>They didn’t want to put me in a marked police car. Instead, they insisted on getting into an unmarked white van. </p>
    <p>It looked like the type of vehicle you’d use to kidnap a victim, drive to an abandoned warehouse, and shoot them in the head. </p>
    <p><strong>Given my position on the kill list, this felt like a real possibility. </strong></p>
    <p>The fight-or-flight mechanism activated in full force. </p>
    <p>Unknown reserves of strength and power flooded my system. </p>
    <p>I kicked and thrashed so savagely they had to tase me ten times, none of which phased me in the slightest. </p>
    <p><strong>For a brief moment, I was immune to pain.</strong> </p>
    <p>Four officers held me down while the fifth bound my wrists. </p>
    <p>Forcing me into the van was still difficult. I thrashed and flailed like a fish out of water.</p>
    <p>The drive was spooky. There were no windows. </p>
    <p>Even scarier, the driver turned the stereo up to max volume, and played one of my favorite songs: “Look What You Made Me Do” by Taylor Swift. This seemed like psychological warfare.</p>
    <p><strong>We arrived at a facility that looked like a jail.</strong> </p>
    <p>There was no identifying information. </p>
    <p>I’ve read enough investigative journalism to know Indefinite Detention Centers exist. </p>
    <p><strong>Government spooks can legally detain or imprison people without limit. They don’t have to prove guilt or have a trial. </strong></p>
    <p>Between the creepy unmarked white van and lack of signage to indicate the facility was a real jail, it felt like I was doomed. </p>
    <p>An automatic gate closed slowly behind the van. I shoved people out of the way and ran at full speed. </p>
    <p>The top half of my body made it outside. Authorities seized me by the legs at the last possible second. </p>
    <p><strong>They escorted me into the building and placed a black hood over my head. </strong></p>
    <p>This practice is called “hooding” and many scholars consider it to be a form of torture. </p>
    <p>It deprives you of sensory input and is often used to obtain information from suspected terrorists during interrogations. </p>
    <p><strong>Minutes later, they removed the hood, and placed me in an empty office.</strong> </p>
    <p>My wrists and ankles were bound to a chair, which restricted movement. I attempted to pull a Houdini, exhausting myself in the process. </p>
    <p>The office contained windows. Outside, employees were in a scramble. </p>
    <p><strong>My mind leaped back to the fear of fire, which caused me to flee in the first place. </strong></p>
    <p>I sensed they were destroying evidence before the building would be set ablaze. </p>
    <p>There was a video camera. Recordings are often stored elsewhere. </p>
    <p>And it’d be suspicious for an &quot;accidental&quot; fire to follow an accurate prediction about what I saw coming. I plead my case to the camera. </p>
    <p><strong>Two officers appeared and escorted me through a maze of corridors.</strong> </p>
    <p>They took me to a cell. I was demanded to strip and hand over my clothes. </p>
    <p>They gave me a red jumpsuit that read: “High Risk Inmate.”  </p>
    <p>And then the adventure got even weirder.</p>
    <h2>Chapter One Analysis</h2>
    <p><strong>All of this is true with one exception: I wasn’t being targeted for assassination.</strong> </p>
    <p>That belief was born from bipolar mania. </p>
    <p>Bipolar disorder causes manic episodes, psychological breaks where you become disconnected with reality. </p>
    <p><strong>The biggest symptom is paranoia. In short, you think the world is aligned against you.</strong> </p>
    <p>This is why I read into people’s word choices -- more specifically, words like “fire” and “furnace” -- despite the fact nobody planned to burn down my house.</p>
    <p><strong>While this was a delusion, the Disposition Matrix and Indefinite Detention are factual programs.</strong> </p>
    <p>The appendix contains sources. The National Security Agency indeed aims to “Collect it all.” Documents released by whistleblower Edward Snowden contain this exact language. </p>
    <p><strong>Their mission is to capture all electronic communication and end privacy on a global scale.</strong> </p>
    <p>It’s unlikely I did anything to warrant their attention, but they could easily pry into your private life on a whim. People don&#x27;t like to think about this stuff and I definitely understand why. </p>
    <p><strong>Awareness of these programs, which are authoritarian regardless of the party in charge, fueled my paranoia.</strong> </p>
    <p>Without that awareness, would I have ever believed I was on the kill list? </p>
    <h3>Uh Oh, You Reached the End (This Is a Preview, Remember?)</h3>
    <p>You must be thinking: “Holy crap, it gets worse?” Indeed it does.</p>
    <p>I bet you’re also wondering what the heck happens next. For now, that’s a secret.</p>
    <p>Follow the instructions inside your confirmation email. Otherwise, I won’t be able to tell you when the book is available. </p>
    <p>In order to satisfy your curiosity, I&#x27;ll close with a Table of Contents that teases where the story goes from here. See below...</p>
