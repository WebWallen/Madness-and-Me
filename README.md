Website associated with Madness and Me, an upcoming mental health memoir by Daniel "Dogfather" Wallen.

See a video that shows off the current look and feel: https://twitter.com/WebWallen/status/1328495416778874882

Don't expect daily commits (I'm merely adding the code here so I don't have to explain my lack of green squares later).

But I WILL update the HTML, CSS, and JS files once or twice a month. Ditto for my pet adoption website (Tri Pets) soon: www.tripets.org
