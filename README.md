Madness and Me, a memoir designed to fight the mental illness stigma and show people how to overcome mental health struggles.

While the memoir isn't released yet, I post one or two articles RE: mental health every week (sign up for a free preview at the end)

If you're in a cold and dark place, I can relate. The content hosted on this website will help you weather the storm and come out stronger.
